askance holds eye

sight wistly view
came stealing wayward boy
note fighting conflict hue
white red destroy

like lowly lover kneels
one fair hand heaveth hat
tender hand fair cheek feels
tend rer cheek receives soft hand print
apt new fall n snow takes dint

oh war looks
eyes petitioners eyes suing
eyes saw eyes seen
eyes woo still eyes disdain wooing
dumb play acts made plain
tears chorus like eyes rain

full gently takes hand
lily prison gaol snow

white friend engirts white foe
beauteous combat wilful unwilling
show like two silver doves sit billing

engine thoughts began
fairest mover mortal round
would thou wert man
heart whole thine thy heart wound
one sweet look thy help would assure thee
though nothing body bane would cure thee

give hand saith dost thou feel
give heart saith thou shalt
give lest thy hard heart steel
steel soft sighs never grave
love deep groans never shall regard
adonis heart hath made mine hard

shame cries let go let go
day delight past horse gone
tis fault bereft
pray hence leave alone
mind thought busy care
get palfrey mare

thus replies thy palfrey
welcomes warm approach sweet desire
affection coal must cool
else suffer set heart fire
sea hath bounds deep desire hath none
therefore marvel though thy horse gone

like jade stood tied tree
servilely master leathern rein
saw love youth fair fee
held petty bondage disdain
throwing base thong bending crest
enfranchising mouth back breast

sees true love naked bed
teaching sheets whiter hue white
glutton eye full hath fed

learn heartily beseech thee
take advantage presented joy
though dumb yet proceedings teach thee
learn love lesson plain

canst thou talk quoth hast thou tongue
would thou hadst hearing
thy mermaid voice hath done double wrong
load press bearing
melodious discord heavenly tune harsh sounding
ear deep sweet music heart deep sore wounding

eyes ears ears would love

deaf thy outward parts would move
part sensible
though neither eyes ears hear see
yet love touching thee

say sense feeling bereft
could see hear touch
nothing smell left
yet would love thee still much
stillitory thy face excelling
comes breath perfum breedeth love smelling

oh banquet wert thou taste

would wish feast might ever last
bid suspicion double lock door
lest jealousy sour unwelcome guest

grief hath two tongues never woman yet
could rule without ten women wit

thus hoping adonis alive
rash suspect doth extenuate
beauty may better thrive
death humbly doth insinuate
tells trophies statues tombs stories

wail death lives must die
till mutual overthrow mortal kind
dead beauty slain

sighs blown away salt tears gone
mine eyes turn fire heart lead
heavy heart lead melt mine eyes red fire
